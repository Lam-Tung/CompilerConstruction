# Compiler Construction in Summer 2021

## This Project is NOT yet ready to be graded!

Why not? 

Because this text is here! This text was written by Prof. Dr. Ronald C. Moore
and he *hates* to see his own texts in students' repositories.

## What should we do?

The very first thing is: Delete This Text!

## That's it?!?

Of course not! Write your own README.md instead! 

Write whether there are branches, or tags -- everything that a visitor would not find to be obvious.

Particularly important: Write your own names here. Take possession of the project.

## Really? It belongs to us?

Not entirely. It will be deleted at the end of Summer Semester 2021.

As such, do not store anything important here, or rather -- make sure that you 
have *other* copies of anything you will want after the end of Summer
Semester 2021.

You have been warned.
